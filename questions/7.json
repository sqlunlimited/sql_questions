  "description": "Given a table of user login data for 2022, write a SQL query to find the number of reactivated users per month — defined as users who were inactive in the previous month but logged in during the current month. A user’s first login in 2022 is also considered a reactivation if they hadn’t logged in during the previous month (e.g., last login was in 2021). Output the month (as a number) and the count of reactivated users.",
